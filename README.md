- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @MandeepJaswal
- üëÄWhat I Do
‚ù§Ô∏è Node.js Backend Development: I build robust, scalable, and efficient backend systems using Node.js and Express. From RESTful APIs to real-time web applications with WebSockets, I love solving problems and optimizing performance.
‚Ä¢ Android Development (Java): With a strong foundation in Android development using Java, I design intuitive, user-friendly mobile applications. Whether it's integrating APIs or ensuring smooth app performance, I focus on delivering quality user experiences.
‚Ä¢ Database Design & Optimization: I work with both SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase) databases, designing efficient schema and optimizing queries for performance.
‚Ä¢ Version Control: Git is my go-to tool for source code management. I'm familiar with Git workflows like GitFlow and branching strategies for collaboration.
‚Ä¢ Cloud & DevOps: I deploy and manage applications on cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, and Firebase, ensuring smooth CI/CD pipelines and scalability.
